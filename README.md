# Chimera buildbot master

This is the [buildbot](https://buildbot.net/) master as used in Chimera's
infrastructure.

To set up, just create a plain master and add the files from inside of this
repo. You will also need to set up workers.

A `user_config.py` must be present. A sample file is included in this repo.
